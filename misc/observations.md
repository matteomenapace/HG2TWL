# MozFest 2015

### What went well

#### Promotion

* Posters around the building (near elevators and coffee stations) attracted people.
* Catchy name: *Hacking games to teach Web Literacy*
* Possibly a curious logo, the bee?

#### Hacktivity

*Hacking rock-paper-scissors*. 

People came up with  a variety of hacking ideas, broadly clustered into: 

1. *Re-skins* of the game, such as adding a back-story, renaming the elements so that the message / settings take on new meaning
2. Changing the game *mechanics*, such as adding / removing elements, modifying the rules to introduce new game states, making the game playable by 3+ people or teams etc.
3. Hacking the game *experience*, using sound and touch for instance
4. A combination of the above

People had been quite stiff up to that point, they loosened up while playing and were more open to talk after the hacktivity.

### What can be improved

#### Intro 

* Explain the workshop aims & outcomes briefly at the beginning, eg:

	> There are 4 key ideas that we're going to explore together: Hacking, games, teaching/learning and Web Literacy.
	
	> It's going to be practical. Little talking, lots of making.
	
	> At the end of the session you'll have a *workshop kit* and plenty of inspirations to take away.

* Figure out **why they're here**. Don't ask open questions at the beginning (cold room, people may be reluctant to speak up) but rather use a *show of hands* exercise, eg: 

	> Hands up if you're here because you want to run this workshop with your class / friends / colleagues / club or community after today..  

* Move quickly into a fun *ice-breaker*, like **Hacktivity: rock-paper-scissors**. After that, there can be a moment for discussion. People will be less stiff and will have something to talk about.

#### Delivery

* Ask questions, don't give them a lecture.

* Acknowledge the diversity of the audience.
 
* Split them into **small groups**, up to 4 people.

* Plan for a **shorter time** and have extra stuff ready if there is more time left than expected.

* **Rehearse** the intro at least, when you'll be more nervous and people are more likely to be thinking 

	> Should I stay or should I go?

* Encourage participants to *learn the game while playing it*

#### Materials

* Have a **printed handout** that mirrors the session's activities and that people can *take away*.

* Have sticky notes and markers ready on the tables for people to jot down ideas. Encourage them (almost give them permission) to use the material.

* Have several copies of the game(s) ready to be played, eg: cards already sorted.

* Game rules must be **printed** (don't expect people to read them online) and **succinct**.
