# Open Beesness

This is a playable simulation of a capitalist economy. 

Each player controls a *bee colony*. 

All colonies operate in the *garden of Commons*.

The goal is to have the most **honey** by the end of the year.

### Setup

How many players? Up to 4 

* Each player starts with 2 worker bees.
* Place **24 flowers** in the garden. 
* Place all the **honey** aside. That will be the *bank*. <sup>If necessary elect a player who will take care of the honey handling.
* Put a **month marker** (any token) on the first month of the year (January?)
* Determine a starting player.
* Place the **nectar cards** aside and face up, stacked by type (6 stacks of 4 cards):

	Name | Cost (honey)	| Extract (flowers) | Condition
	---- | ------------	| ----------------- | ---------
	Worker 		| 1      	| 1            | if garden > 15 
	Drone 		| 3    	 	| 2            | if garden > 15 
	Queen 		| 5      	| 3            | if garden > 15 
	??????  	| 5      	| 1            |  
	??????    	| 8      	| 2            |  
	Sting     	| 10     	| 3            |  

### Gameplay

Every month is comprised by 8 **phases**:

1. **Planning**

	All players, at the same time, play one nectar card among the ones they acquired. At every planning phase they decide which one to use without declaring their intentions??
2. **Priority**

	Players can invest extra honey to take priority in the extraction phase. They can do so by bidding freely. The highest bidder gets the steering wheel and gives the honey to the bank.

	Bidding is not necessary, it may be useful in time of *scarcity* later in the game.
3. **Extraction**

	Starting from the player with the steering wheel and proceeding clockwise, players extract the number of flowers corresponding to the nectar card they played - if there are flowers left.

	If the condition `more than 15 flowers in the garden` on a card is not met at the beginning of a player's turn, she will not extract any flowers.
4. **Market price**

	Determine the price of flowers for the year by looking at the price chart line corresponding to the total number of flowers extracted by all players.
	
	HARVEST | PRICE
	------- | -----
	more than 10 | 1
	7 - 10       | 2
	less than 7  | 3
	Flowers extracted by all players this year | Per flowers
	
5. **Income**

	Each player gets an amount of honey equal to the market price multiplied by the number of flowers she caught this year. 
	
	Extracted flowers are set apart.
6. **Investment**

	Starting from the player with the steering wheel and proceeding clockwise, players can decide to acquire nectar cards by paying their cost to the bank.

	Nectar cards are never discarded and return in players' hands. At every planning phase they decide which one to use without declaring their intentions.
7. **Regeneration**

	For each 3 remaining flowers, add 1 flowers to the garden up to a maximum of 30.

	Example: if there are 7 flowers left, add 2.
8. **End year**

	Move the month marker to the next space to keep track of the rounds.

	If the marker in on the last month the game ends and the winner is the player with most honey.

	Otherwise the player with the steering wheel passes it to the player on her left and a new month starts.

### End game

The game can end before the 12th turn if all flowers are extracted or after 3 consecutive turns with scarce extraction. 

In this cases *everybody loses*.


## Hackable ideas

* Different types of flowers?
