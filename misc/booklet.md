# Workshop booklet

#### A. Goals

1. Hacking **mindset** (B)
* Games as *object to think with* (C)
* Analog games as co-design tools (D)

#### B. Rock-paper-scissors hack <SUP>HACKTIVITY

Make groups of 2-3 people and hack the popular game [rock-paper-scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).

What aspects of this game can you hack? 

Jot down **all your ideas** (no idea is a bad idea) and play-test them with your group!

#### C. What are the **ingredients** of a game? <sup>DISCUSSION

Now that you hacked a game, what are its ingredients? You can start by listing the ones you changed.

What are games made of? Write **your game's ingredients** below

<!-- People should come up with things like rules, players, objects.. -->

By hacking games we can better understand how they work.

We can also make games that help us understand how *other things* work!

Did you know that Monopoly was originally designed by a lady called Elizabeth Magie to teach the (very obscure) economic philosophy of Georgism? [Yas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord's_Game)!

#### D. Analog game hack <sup> HACKTIVITY

Choose a simple analog game (we recommend [Code Monkey Island](http://codemonkeyplanet.com), [Bits & Bytes](http://www.bitsandbytes.cards), [Beesness](../beesness)..), play it **critically** and **hack it** as you go!

> Don't bother learning the rules too much, make them!

Then, repeat `C` applied to this game.


#### A hacker does... <sup>OPTIONAL

This activity can be played if your audience is concerned about the negative connotation of words like *hacking* and *hacker*.

1. Ask people to write down a list of **verbs** that describe what you think a hacker does.
* Collect the verbs (either on post-its or write them on a flipboard) and generate a debate around them. Some pointers:

	* good hackers - bad hackers
	* hacking as a creative practice: hacking the new out of the old
	* hacking as changing / modifying something (possibly to improve it)
	* hacking as a curious, questioning **mindset**

#### Why analog games? <sup>OPTIONAL

Food for thought:

* More collaborative
* No entry barriers (like coding skills)
* Easier to hack: all elements are physical, there are no moving parts
* Even video games start as paper prototypes (not just video games actually, many projects start on a piece of paper)
* An analog game prototype is already a playable game!

#### Are games stories? <sup>OPTIONAL

This activity can be played if you want to explore the differences between narrative media (film, novels) and procedural media (games).

1. On a flipboard (or large piece of paper) write `STORIES` on one extreme and `GAMES` on the other.
* Let's **brainstorm** concepts related to games and stories, what they have in common and what they don't have in common.

<!--

Games create meaning through the **dynamic interaction** between game rules, game resources and players (what game designers call *gameplay*).

Games are pretty good at **simulating complex systems**, and making them playable!
