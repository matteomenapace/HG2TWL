# Games as systems

From [Designing Games to Understand Complexity](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/designing-games-to-understand-complexity)

> Some issues seem to have way too many *moving parts* to be reduced to personal stories or linear cause-and-effect relationships. That’s where games and simulations can help! By playing and making games we can take a step out of the social systems we inhabit, conceptualise them as a whole, identify the conflicting forces in play, and envision better **systems**.

### What are **systems**?

> We often use the terms `system` to refer to a number of very different things, natural, technological or social, the solar system, the operating system, the prison system, the eco system.

<!--Without spending too much time, can anyone think of a simple **definition** of system?-->

> Generally speaking, a system is a set of interconnected things (or elements, or components) that form an unified whole. To use a now common catchphrase, this *whole is more than the sum of its parts*.

### Can you understand bees by looking at a single bee?

> You can’t quite understand the biology of bees just by dissecting one specimen. You can only understand its internal system (how they store pollen, the sting etc.).

![](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/bee_flower.png)

> Systems can be embedded in other systems. The single bee system is part of the colony system and as we know populations of bees are important part of larger ecosystems because they are pollinators. They are part of the reproductive organs of many plants.

### Is a zoo an ecosystem?

Not every set of things is a system.

In a system elements have **interactions** and / or **interdependencies**.

> The collection of animals in a *zoo* is not an ecosystem. There’s little or no interaction or interdependency between them.

> But if you remove all the zebras from the *savannah* you are going to dramatically affect the entire ecosystem.

### What is the difference between a system **purpose** and its  **function**?

> The function of human systems may be different than their stated goals.

In other words, the way a system actually works and the outcome it produces, may be different than the way it *should* work.

<!-- Think about a few [...]systems. -->

> The conservative person may see crime as an isolated relationship between people, as an immoral choice. And sees prison as a necessary deterrent, as a solution.

> On the other hand a progressive minded person is more likely to see crime within an encompassing system of inequality which, arguably, includes the prison system as well.

###  Don’t look at the **players**, look at the **rules** of the game.

> We know the rules and the components but certain dynamics and patterns emerge only when the system is **in motion**, when it’s running or it’s being played.

By playing games and, even more so, by making games we can understand complex systems.

> Because games and simulations can simplify and mirror certain aspects of real world systems while maintaining their *dynamic properties*.

### Feedback

> The most crucial aspect of all systems are feedbacks.

> Now, in common usage feedback has become a synonym of comment or suggestion.

> More technically speaking a feedback is an **output** that is fed back to the **input** and **conditions** it.

What feedback loops can you spot in the game we just played?

### Types of feedback loops

#### Balancing loops

> A balancing loop attempts to move a current state to a desired state.

Example: fish population growth is balancing the loss from fishing.

![](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/balancing.png)

Can you think of other balancing loops?

#### Reinforcing loops

> A reinforcing loop is one in which an action produces a result which influences more of the same action thus resulting in growth or decline.

> This dynamic is an example of what system analysts call *system traps*. Which are common systems, or archetypes that cause trouble [...] The rich gets richer, the powerful gets more power and so on.

![](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/reinforcing-loop.png)

> This happen when the winner of a competition are rewarded with the means to win again.

> This system archetype is built-in in many games (Monopoly, Chess, Settlers of Catan, Risk) because we want games to reach an end with winners and losers.

Can you think of ways to counter reinforcing loops, both in games and IRL? 

<!--Some examples:
-Limiting the rewards (antitrust)
-Balancing systems (taxes, affirmative action)
-Levelling the competition (debt cancellation, tax inheritance, meritocracy and access)-->

#### Escalation

> We are all familiar with escalation. It’s the cold war arm race, it happens when you have an argument with your partner. Here, if a player decides to escalate the technological investment, the other players are committed to match the effort or even to try to exceed it.

![](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/escalation.png)

> What are the possible way out to escalation as a system trap?

* Defeat of one player
* De-escalation

#### Competing loops

> Normally in the game and in real markets, the law of demand function as a balancing loop: the more you fish, the more is the offer, the more the prices drop.

> So this is theoretically a deterrent to overfishing.

![](http://www.molleindustria.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/overfishing.png)

> However in time of scarcity, when you are running out of fish, the market can’t get flooded.
So there’s a great temptation to extract the remaining resources for higher gain.

> This other reinforcing feedback loop becomes dominant, you are awarded for doing more of the same.

> This system trap is another well known one: the **tragedy of the commons**.

> The tragedy of the commons is the depletion of a shared resource by individuals, acting independently and rationally according to each one’s **self-interest**, despite their understanding that depleting the common resource is contrary to the **group’s long-term best interests**.


## Let's play a game *critically*

1. Play the thing ([see `Fishery` below](#fishery)).
* Analyse it as a *system*. Observe patterns and **feedback loops**.
* Hack its *rules* and/or *components* (to prevent problematic trends to happen).
* Play-test your hacked versions!

### Fishery

Can we tell the story of a dysfunctional food system through a board game?
