# Learning by <del>playing</del> making games

Do you play games? How about making games for a couple of hours?

In this practical workshop you will learn how to **hack analog games** (think Monopoly) to explore *Web Literacy*.

By the end, you will have a **playable prototype** of your new game, and a *workshop idea* to use in your classroom!

### What is **hacking**?

<!-- Is this your first time at MozFest? How many times have you heard the word hacker / hacking today? You will hear it a few times throughout the festival.. -->

<!-- 
Quick show of hands:
 
* How many of you would describe themselves as educators?
* Makers / creatives?
* Designers? 
* Technologists?
* Hackers?

<!--#### What does hacking mean to you?-->

#### Can we understand hacking as a **neutral**, or even **positive** practice? 

Hacking intended as the practice of *modifying* something, possibly to *improve* it.

> Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.

> [A Hacker Manifesto](http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html) by Mackenzie Wark

#### A hacker practices creativity as **hacking the new out of the old**

<!--#### In this workshop we're going to be **hackers**-->

A hacker is intellectually curious, a critical thinker who is not afraid of subverting systems to her own needs, responding to the principles of the communities she belongs to.

Our challenge as educators today is to help students become the *hackers*, not the mere *consumers*, of technology.

<!-- This is what MozFest is about -->

If you're uncomfortable with the term `hacking`, then you can replace it with `remixing` and that will do.


### Why **games**?

<!-- > I hear and I forget.

> I see and I remember.

> **I do and I understand.**

I'm a bit fan of *learning by doing*. More precisely, Seymour Papert's [constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)).

> Learning can happen most effectively when people are active in *making tangible objects* in the real world.

#### Learning by <del>playing</del> making games

Young people are avid *consumers* of games, especially video games. 

<!-- 

#### Gamifuckation 

There's a whole “movement” devoted to pouring game mechanics into non-game activities and to spark some “fun” and “engagement” in dull subjects or inconvenient tasks, but this is not a workshop about gamification.

-->

**Making** (as opposed to consuming) games is the key. 

To make a game you need to *research* the subject of your game, you need to **conceptualise a system** of players, resources and rules, and then define how they all interact. 

The process involves *planning*, *testing*, *evaluating* feedback and *iterating* your prototype. 

And once you've made a game, you'll start playing other games *critically*.

#### Games are **systems** of rules

Linear media (such as films and novels) typically create meaning through **storytelling**. 

![](assets/story-ball.png)

Yet some issues seem to have way too many **moving parts** to be reduced to personal stories or linear cause-and-effect relationships. That's where games and simulations can help!

Games create meaning through the **dynamic interaction** between game rules, game resources and players (what game designers call *gameplay*).

Games are pretty good at **simulating complex systems**, and making them playable!

> By making games we can take a step out of the social systems we inhabit, conceptualise them as a whole, identify the conflicting forces in play, and envision better **systems**.

### How does one **hack a game**?

![](assets/rock-paper-scissors.jpg)

Let's hack [rock-paper-scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).

Some ideas:

* What if you **remove** one element? 
* What if you **add** one element?
* How about changing the number of **players**? 
* What if you introduce new **rules**? 
* Who says you can only use your hands? What about the rest of the body?
* Who says you can only use visual signs? How about **noises** or smells?
* What do you **know** about the other player's strategy?
* Is there a **strategy** to win this game?
* What if you change the **goal** of the game?
* How about turning it into a **collaborative** game? 
* How about **renaming** the elements? 
* Can you think of a different **story** (narrative) for this game?
* What **messages** may the gameplay communicate?

<!-- 

Abstracting: A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A
 
Japanese mushi-ken: frog, slug & snake
Kitsune-ken: fox, mayor, hunter
Malaysia: bird, water, stone

Balance:
As long as the number of moves is an odd number and that each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combination of moves will function as a game. 
 
Psychology? 
Attack and defence
Chance or pattern recognition?

Simultaneous decision game

Zero-sum game: wins for the winner are equal to the losses for the loser

-->

#### What can we hack? 

1. The **skin** of the game. 

	Easy, but a we're just scratching the surface.
* The **gameplay**, that is the *dynamic relationship* between game rules, game resources and players.

	More fun!   
  
	Turning the original game into something that plays differently, even though it may look similar.


### Why **analog games**?

[![](assets/escape-the-bullies.jpg)](https://medium.com/@baddeo/every-child-is-a-game-designer-982d15aed199)

1. You don't need to *code*. And even if you can code, game design starts from **sketching, visualising, paper-prototyping**.  
  
	Even *videogames* have to be designed as **rule systems** before becoming software.
* The process of designing an analog game is more collaborative and accessible.  
  
	All team members can throw ideas on the table, move pieces of paper around and **think together**.
* 	In videogames rules and mechanics are often *hidden* from the player(s), who delegate(s) the game engine to enforce them.  
  
	With analog games, players are trained to keep an eye on each other, and rules are being *interpreted* by their brains all the time while playing.  
  
	Board games can foster **computational thinking**, according to [this paper](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1138&context=itls_facpub).

### Let's play a game **critically**!

<!-- > Don’t look at the **players**, look at the **rules** of the game.-->

Games and simulations can simplify and mirror certain aspects of real world systems while maintaining their *dynamic properties*.

When we study a game as a system, we can learn about its rules and its components, but certain dynamics and **patterns** will emerge only when the system is **in motion**. That is, when the game is being played.

Let's split up in groups, each playing one of these games **critically**!

1. **Open Beesness**

* **Code Monkey Island**

	[![](http://codemonkeyplanet.com/images/product-7.jpg)](http://codemonkeyplanet.com/)
* **Bits & Bytes**

#### Analyse the game as a ***system*** 

The most crucial aspect of all systems are feedbacks.

Now, in common usage feedback has become a synonym for *comment* or *suggestion*.

Technically speaking a feedback is an **output** that is fed back to the **input** and **conditions** it.

What **feedback loops** can you spot in the game we just played?

* **Balancing loop**   
  
	For example: flower growth is balancing the loss from picking.

* **Reinforcing loop**   
  
	Winners keep on winning.. this is built into many games (Monopoly, Chess, Settlers of Catan, Risk) because we want games to reach an end with winners and losers.   
  
	Can you think of ways to counter **reinforcing loops**, both in games and IRL? 

* **Escalation**  
  
	If a player decides to grow the colony (or invest in drones), the other players are committed to match the effort or even to try to exceed it.  
  
	What are the possible way out of escalation as a system trap?

	<!--Some examples:
	-Limiting the rewards (antitrust)
	-Balancing systems (taxes, affirmative action)
	-Levelling the competition (debt cancellation, tax inheritance, meritocracy and access)-->

* What about another system trap: the **tragedy of the commons**?


### Let's **hack** an analog game!

1. Hack its *rules* and/or *components*.
* Play-test your hacked versions!

<!-- to prevent problematic trends to happen -->

### Web Lit

#### The problem

> Since the mid-1990s more and more products, services and scenes from everyday life have moved online. The Open Web that Mozilla believes in so strongly is now **under attack from a variety of forces**.

> From the [Mozilla Webmaker white paper](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/) 

Can you make a game that lets you play with these conflicting forces?

<!--

* commercial silos
* elegant consumption

-->

#### What is Web Literacy?

> The DIY potential for **connected**, **participatory**, **improvisational learning** requires new skills, what many are calling new *literacies*.

> Just what is it that people should be getting better at to avoid being stuck in the trap of *elegant consumption*?

> Web Literacy is the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing, and participating on the Web.

[![](assets/web-literacy-map.png)](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/)

<!-- [Mozilla Web Literacy](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/web-literacy/) -->

Couple of ideas:

* Can you hack a game that lets players **explore** the Web Literacy map, or parts of it?
* Can you make a game that **facilitates conversations** around the skills in the Web Lit map?
