# Hacking games to teach Web Literacy

Are you a *gamer*? How about becoming a **game designer** for a couple of hours?

In this workshop you will **hack board games** (think Monopoly) with a new theme: *Web Literacy*.

By the end, you will have a **playable prototype** of your new game, and a *workshop idea* to use in your classroom!

### Plan

1. [What is *hacking*?](#what-is-hacking)
* Why are we hacking games?
* How does one hack a game?
	* Let's hack rock-paper-scissors.
* Hacking board games?
	* Let's hack a board game.
* Web Lit 

### What is **hacking**?

<!-- Is this your first time at MozFest? How many times have you heard the word hacker / hacking today? You will hear it a few times throughout the festival.. -->

#### What does hacking mean to you?

#### Can we understand hacking as a **neutral**, or even **positive** practice? 

Hacking intended as the practice of *modifying* something, possibly to *improve* it.

> Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.

#### In this workshop we're going to be **hackers**

A hacker is intellectually curious, a critical thinker who is not afraid of subverting systems to her own needs, responding to the principles of the communities she belongs to.

#### A hacker practices creativity as **hacking the new out of the old**

Our challenge as educators today is to help students become the hackers, not the mere consumers, of technology.
