# Learning by ~~playing~~ making games

### Nice to meet you!

* Who are you?
* Why are you here?

### Why are we doing this?

This workshop is about **making games to understand systems** (including Web Literacy). It's about deconstructing games critically and reassembling them with an inquisitive mindset. 

The goal of this workshop is not to come up with game ideas, but rather **game-making workshop ideas**, which you can use to facilitate the learning of a theme / skill (such as Web Lit).

# 1. Hacking...

<!-- Is this your first time at MozFest? How many times have you heard the word hacker / hacking today? You will hear it a few times throughout the festival.. -->

#### Can we understand hacking as a *neutral*, or even *positive* practice? 

Hacking intended as the practice of *modifying* something, possibly to *improve* it.

> Whatever code we hack, be it programming language, poetic language, math or music, curves or colourings, we create the possibility of new things entering the world. Not always great things, or even good things, but new things.

> [A Hacker Manifesto](http://subsol.c3.hu/subsol_2/contributors0/warktext.html) by Mackenzie Wark

#### A hacker practices creativity as *hacking the new out of the old*

A hacker is intellectually curious, a critical thinker who is not afraid of subverting systems to her own needs, responding to the principles of the communities she belongs to.

In that sense, our challenge as educators today is to help learners become the *hackers*, instead of the mere *consumers*, of technology.


# 2. Hacking games...

Young people are avid *consumers* of games, especially video games. 

**Making** (as opposed to consuming) games is the key. 

[![](assets/confucius.png)](http://blog.ncase.me/i-do-and-i-understand)

I'm a big fan of *learning by doing*. More precisely, Seymour Papert's [constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)).

> Learning can happen most effectively when people are active in *making tangible objects* in the real world.

<!--
To make a game you need to *research* the subject of your game, you need to **conceptualise a system** of players, resources and rules, and then define how they all interact. 

The process involves *planning*, *testing*, *evaluating* feedback and *iterating* your prototype. 

And once you've made a game, you'll start playing other games *critically*.
-->

## How does one *hack a game*?

![](assets/rock-paper-scissors.jpg)

Let's hack [rock-paper-scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).

Some ideas:

* **Add** or **remove** one element
* **Rename** the elements
* Change the **number of players** 
* Change the **rules** 
* Use the rest of the **body** (not just hands)
* Use **noises** or smells (not only visual signs)
* Is there a **strategy** to win this game?
* What do you **know** about the other player's strategy?
* What if you change the **goal** of the game?
* Can you turn it into a **collaborative** game? 

<!-- 

Abstracting: A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A
 
Japanese mushi-ken: frog, slug & snake
Kitsune-ken: fox, mayor, hunter
Malaysia: bird, water, stone

Balance:
As long as the number of moves is an odd number and that each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half, any combination of moves will function as a game. 
 
Psychology? 
Attack and defence
Chance or pattern recognition?

Simultaneous decision game

Zero-sum game: wins for the winner are equal to the losses for the loser

### What can we hack? 

One way to understand games is to analyse their **mechanics**, **dynamics** and **aesthetics** (aka the [MDA framework](assets/mda.pdf)

**Mechanics** are the *rules* by which a game should work.

Dynamics and aesthetics are the outcomes a game produces. In particular, **dynamics** are patterns of play reinforced or encouraged by a game's mechanic (what players tend to do in order to reach their game goals); **aesthetics** are what the player experiences.

For example, in *Chess*: 

* the mechanic of putting a king into check limits that king's owner to actions that get the king out of check
* a typical dynamic is that players start with pawns and shift their focus on other elements as the board clears and moves become more sweeping and powerful
* the aesthetics are those of a medieval, open battle between two armies, where players take the role of commanders trying to outsmart each other
 
**Mechanics give rise to dynamics, which in turn shape the players' choices and experiences.**

As game makers, we can hack the rules of the game, but we can't control how players will interpret those rules and whether they'll have fun playing. Like *policy-makers*, we can only encourage / enforce certain behaviours, but we can't be sure people will behave like we envisioned. 

We create a **system of mechanics** but we do not directly create the player's experience. 

### Games as *systems*

Another way to understand games is to analyse them as systems.

We often use the word `system` to talk about very different things: the solar system, the operating system, the prison system, the ecosystem.

A system is a **set of interconnected things** (or elements, or components) that form an unified **whole**. To use a now common catchphrase:

> The whole is more than the sum of its parts.

In a system elements have **interactions** and / or **interdependencies**.

![](assets/bee_flower.png)

You can't understand an ecosystem just by analysing one part of it (eg: only the bees). Likewise, you can't make sense of human systems just by looking at the behaviour of individual *players*.

Games are often inspired by real world systems, which they generally simplify to make them playable.

> By making games we can take a step out of the social systems we inhabit, conceptualise them as a whole, identify the conflicting forces in play, and envision better **systems**.

> [Designing games to understand complexity](misc/games-as-systems.md) by Paolo Pedercini

Through game-hacking, we can promote system literacy.

### Feedbacks

The most crucial aspect of all systems are feedbacks.

We commonly use `feedback` as a synonym for *comment* or *suggestion*.

Technically speaking a feedback is an **output** that is fed back to the **input** and **conditions** it.

Types of **feedback loops**: 

* **Balancing loop**   
  	
  	A balancing loop attempts to move the current state to a desired state.
  	
	We can spot this in nature, where predators and preys populations balance each other.
	
	*Demand and supply* is another example of a balancing loop.

* **Reinforcing loop**   
  
  	A reinforcing loop is one in which an action produces a result which influences more of the same action, resulting in growth or decline.
  	
	Also known as *system trap*, this type of loop is built into many games (Monopoly, Chess, Settlers of Catan, Risk) because we want games to reach an end with winners and losers. 
	
	Sometimes reinforcing loops lead to **escalation** (e.g. when you argue with someone) or to the **tragedy of the commons** (the depletion of a shared resource by individuals, acting independently and rationally according to self-interest, despite their understanding that depleting the common resource is contrary to the collective long-term interests). 
  
	Can you think of ways to counter **reinforcing loops**, both in games and IRL? 
	
	<!-- 
	-Limiting the rewards (antitrust)
	-Balancing systems (taxes, affirmative action)
	-Levelling the competition (debt cancellation, tax inheritance, meritocracy and access)

# 3. Hacking games to teach Web Literacy

Now that you dipped your toes into *game hacking* and *system thinking*, how can we apply these to Web Literacy?

### The problem

> Since the mid-1990s more and more products, services and scenes from everyday life have moved online. The Open Web that Mozilla believes in so strongly is now **under attack from a variety of forces**.

> From the [Mozilla Webmaker white paper](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/) 

### What is Web Literacy?

> The DIY potential for **connected**, **participatory**, **improvisational learning** requires new skills, what many are calling new *literacies*.

> Just what is it that people should be getting better at to avoid being stuck in the trap of *elegant consumption*?

> Web Literacy is the skills and competencies needed for reading, writing, and participating on the Web.

[![](assets/web-literacy-map.png)](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy)

Letâ€™s brainstorm: pick your favourite verb from the Web Literacy map or use the [game idea generator](http://bit.ly/weblit-hacktivity-ideas-generator) to come up with a **game-hacking idea**, then explain to the rest of us how you envision it working with a group of learners.
